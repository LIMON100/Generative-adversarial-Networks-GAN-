# Uncented Kalman Filters

Uncented kalman filter is a variant of extended kalman filter that uses the uncented transform to provide a better approximation of a non-linear probability distribution transformations used inside a filter.
Uses gaussian approximation of a sampled-based non-linear transformation of a probability distribution.
