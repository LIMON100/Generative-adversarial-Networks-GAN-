# Kalman Filters

Kalman Filter is an estimator which solves the ‘linear quadratic estimation problem’, which just means that it estimates the instantaneous state of a linear dynamic system perturbed by random white noise, and it does it by taking a series of measurements that are linearly related to the state but which are also corrupted by random white noise.

The Kalman Filter (KF) is a set of mathematical equations that when operating together implement a predictor-corrector type of estimator that is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the estimated error covariance when some presumed conditions are met.
